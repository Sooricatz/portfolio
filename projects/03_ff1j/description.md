Communication and General Management for a French short movie festival.

Initiated in 2005 with friends and supported by the <a href="http://www.utbm.fr/">University of Technology of Belfort-Montb√©liard</a>, the idea behind the FF1J is to ask 15 teams to produce a short film in 50hours (or less) on a given theme and then present it to a jury of professionals.
