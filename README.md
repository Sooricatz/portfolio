portfolio
=========

My own portfolio/playground (unstable dev branche)

### Optimizations
- Preprocess MD to html/php as much as possible and cache the pages on the server
- Cache CSS, js and images in browser
- gzip the site (if possible on hosting)
- Avoid duplicate pages (301 redirects)
- Deliver images from different sizes

### Ideas
- Create a landing screen detailling 1 project at a time
- Load projects with AJAX
- Create unique portfolio listings for different target groups
- Migrate to [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com/)
